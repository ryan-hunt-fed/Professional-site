            <h2>Ryan Hunt</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Hi, I am a New Zealand citizen trying to make my way in the world. </p>
            <h3>Career Intentions</h3>
            <p>Currently my Career intentions are to have a mix of development and design for mainly web products and UI, I am open to other avenues should they be presented in such a way but these are my main goals. I ideally would like to lean more into the design side more than the development but as long as I have some form of design in my work that should be enough as one of my main career goals is to have a creative side to it. I am always eager to learn as I just want to improve my skills generally. As I would like to learn areas of Three.js, webGL, and other code knowledge on my journey.</p>
            <p>My other intentions would be to try to earn a living with my 3D art. I will always have a spot in my mind of wanting to work on games, but I know that the games industry is tough in many different ways, also more so for being in New Zealand. Should things still not work out in that way, I fully intend on trying to make my own things wheather they be my own games or my own minature line for tabletop games. As I have stated previously I just enjoy making different things. I am looking to improve my skills when I can and learn new programs such as zBrush and substance painter.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies & Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>In my personal life, I like to play video games, get together with friends to either play Magic the Gathering or Dungeons and Dragons, drawing (Both digitally and physically), miniature painting, 3D modeling and animation, catching up on the various media I&#39;m interested in.</p>
            <p>Things I would like to get into at some stage would be learning piano, getting my guitar out again, video editing, photography (Specifically Astrophotography), 3D printing and archery.</p>
